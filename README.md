# How will self-driving cars impact our roads?

Self-driving cars are already on the road, but we're still learning how they interact with obstacles and human drivers.

This simulation represents one possible scenario for human drivers and self-driving cars sharing the road. In our simulation, self-driving cars are technically safer drivers, staying at the speed limit and keeping a constant eye on their neighbors, whereas human drivers are failable, speeding and ocassionally missing something.

However, in the simulation, it turns out that it's the slower drivers, not the speeders, that cause the accidents (which you can see as red flashes in the simulation) by not being able to respond to hazards quickly enough. Obviously, this is a very simple model, but it shows how such complex systems can challenge our expectations.
